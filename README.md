# UFOs

## Overview of Project: 
Updating Dana's webpage on UFO sightings by adding more filter options of city, state, country and shape.

## Results:
With the addition of the specific filter options, there are now more ways to narrow down your search by typing in your request and pressing enter.

1. In this example, we are searching for Circle shaped sightings. Once pressing the "enter" key, this outputted all the locations of circle shaped sightings.

2. To clear the search, delete the request and press enter to resort back to all the findings, ensuring that the default words are greyed out in the search fields.

## Summary:
One drawback of this design may be that once you refresh the webpage, the filter does not stay and it resorts back to all the data.
Some additional recommendations that may be helpful for this webpage is adding another filter option by adding Duration as a search option.
Another may be to consider drop down menus instead of typing out the request, especially for those who may not where to start looking through the data. 
A drop down menu can help further narrow down their search by limiting them to what areas to focus on when looking into UFO sightings.
